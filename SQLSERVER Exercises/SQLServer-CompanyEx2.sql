--1. We have noticed that certain customers prefer to make their orders with certain employees. We want
--to increase business by encouraging the customer/employee pairs that are more productive, and to
--channel the pairs that are less productive into other relationships. To this end, we have ordered this
--query and the following three. First, I need the customer ID, the customer contact name, the employee
--ID, the employee name, the order ID, the number of orders, and the total amount of each order, where
--the customer/employee pair has produced five or more orders between them, ordered by the dollar
--amount of the order from highest to lowest. The output needs to be in a comma separated format
--with strings that include spaces and commas delimited by double quotes. The dollar amount should
--be formatted as a decimal number with two decimal places. Here is the output.
select c.customerid, c.contactname, e.employeeid, e.firstname || ' ' || e.lastname as emp_name, o.orderid, Count(o.orderid) as num_orders, printf("%.2f",Sum(od.unitprice *od.quantity)) as order_total from customers c join orders o on c.customerid = o.customerid join employees e on o.employeeid = e.employeeid join order_details od on o.orderid = od.orderid group by c.customerid, e.employeeid, o.orderid having count(o.orderid) >= 5 order by order_total desc;

--2. Second, I want the least productive pairs with the same columns. The total of orders should be less
--than three, the dollar amount of the order is less than $50.00, and the orders are ranked by increasing
--dollar amounts, starting with the least order. Here is the expected output.
select c.customerid, c.contactname, e.employeeid, e.firstname || ' ' || e.lastname as emp_name, o.orderid, Count(o.orderid) as num_orders, printf("%.2f",Sum(od.unitprice *od.quantity)) as order_total from customers c join orders o on c.customerid = o.customerid join employees e on o.employeeid = e.employeeid join order_details od on o.orderid = od.orderid group by c.customerid, e.employeeid, o.orderid having count(o.orderid) < 3 and sum(od.unitprice * od.quantity) < 50 order by order_total;

--3. Third, I need the most productive pairs as in the first report above, omitting the order ID but ranked
--by the average amount from highest to lowest of all orders by the customer/employee pair. Include
--only pairs where the amount of the average exceeds $2,500.00. Here is the expected output.
select c.customerid, c.contactname, e.employeeid, e.firstname || ' ' || e.lastname as emp_name, count(o.orderid) as num_orders, printf("%.2f", Avg(od.unitprice * od.quantity)) as order_avg from customers c join orders o on c.customerid = o.customerid join employees e on o.employeeid = e.employeeid join order_details od on o.orderid = od.orderid group by c.customerid, e.employeeid, o.orderid having avg(od.unitprice * od.quantity) > 2500 order by order_avg desc;

--4. Finally, I need the least productive pairs as ranked by average order amount, from lowest to highest,
--formatted as above. Omit the order ID. Include only pairs where the average order amount is less than
--$50.00. Here is the expected output.
select c.customerid, c.contactname, e.employeeid, e.firstname || ' ' || e.lastname as emp_name, count(o.orderid) as num_orders, printf("%.2f", Avg(od.unitprice * od.quantity)) as order_avg from customers c join orders o on c.customerid = o.customerid join employees e on o.employeeid = e.employeeid join order_details od on o.orderid = od.orderid group by c.customerid, e.employeeid, o.orderid having avg(od.unitprice * od.quantity) < 50 order by order_avg;

--5. Please create a report with the order ID, the customer ID, the customer name, the customer country,
--and the dollar amount of the order, sorted alphabetically by country and numerically from highest to
--lowest by the dollar amount of the order, where the order total exceeds $5,000.00. Here is the output.
select c.customerid, c.contactname, e.employeeid, e.firstname || ' ' || e.lastname as emp_name, count(o.orderid) as num_orders, printf("%.2f", sum(od.unitprice * od.quantity)) as total_order from customers c join orders o on c.customerid = o.customerid join employees e on o.employeeid = e.employeeid join order_details od on o.orderid = od.orderid group by o.orderid having sum(od.unitprice * od.quantity) > 5000 order by total_order desc;

--6.I want to know the unique (distinct) cities, regions, and postal codes: 
.mode column

--(a) where we have both customers and employees.
 select distinct c.city as CustomerCity, c.region as CustomerRegion, c.postalcode as CustomerPostalCode, e.city as EmployeeCity, e.region as EmployeeRegion, e.postalcode as EmployeePostalCode from customers c join employees e on c.city = e.city and c.region = e.region and c.postalcode = e.postalcode;


--(b) where we have customers but no employees AND both customers and employees.
select distinct c.city as customercity, c.region as customerregion, c.postalcode as customerpostalcode, e.city as employeecity, e.region as employeeregion, e.postalcode as employeepostalcode from customers c left join employees e on c.city = e.city and c.region = e.region and c.postalcode = e.postalcode; 


--(c) where we have employees but no customers AND both customers and employees. Write three
--queries, using inner and outer joins. Report the results of the queries. There is no need for any further
--reporting.
select distinct c.city as customercity, c.region as customerregion, c.postalcode as customerpostalcode, e.city as employeecity, e.region as employeeregion, e.postalcode as employeepostalcode from employees e left join customers c on c.city = e.city and c.region = e.region and c.postalcode = e.postalcode;
